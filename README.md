The script includes input validation to ensure that the date entered is within a specific range and is valid.

Features:

  > Accepts and validates the user's birth date within the range of 1700 to 2050.
  > Displays the day of the week corresponding to the entered birth date.
  > Provides error handling for invalid inputs.

  1. Run the Script: Execute the script using a Python interpreter.
  2. Enter Your Details: Follow the prompts to enter your first name, last name, birth year, month, and day.
  3. View the Result: The script will display the day of the week you were born.

# Code Explanation:
import datetime  # Import datetime module

print("Hello dear sir.")  # Create a hello sir prompt

# Create a special note
print("""NOTE:   
--> Here you can view any year date between 1700 to 2050,
--> so you must enter between 1700 to 2050.
--> Have a nice day sir, thank you! :)""")
first_name = input("* Enter your first name: ").capitalize()  # Create a variable for first name
last_name = input("* Enter your last name: ").capitalize()  # Create a variable for last name

# Create a birthdate function
def birth_date(year, month, day):
    days = datetime.date(year, month, day)
    return days.strftime("%A")

# Create a while loop
while True:
    # Create a try block method to test a block of code for errors
    try:
        # Create a year variable for user's birth year input
        year = int(input(f"* Enter your birth year MR.{first_name} {last_name}: "))
        if year < 1700 or year > 2050:
            print("Please enter a year between 1700 and 2050.")
            continue
        # Create a month variable for user's birth month input
        month = int(input(f"* Enter your birth month MR.{first_name} {last_name}: "))
        if month < 1 or month > 12:
            print("Please enter a valid month (1-12).")
            continue
        # Create a day variable for user's birth day input
        day = int(input(f"* Enter your birth day MR.{first_name} {last_name}: "))
        if day < 1 or day > 31:
            print("Please enter a valid day (1-31).")
            continue
        # Create a day of the week variable to determine birthdate
        day_of_the_week = birth_date(year, month, day)
        print(f"Hay MR.{first_name} {last_name} you were born on '{day_of_the_week}', of the '{month}th' month of {year}. :)")
        break
    # Handle invalid inputs
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input, please enter a number.")
    except:
        print("Invalid date, please enter a valid date.")

Requirements
  > Python 3.x

Notes
  > Ensure the inputs are within the specified range (1700 to 2050) for the year, and valid ranges for the month (1-12) and day (1-31).
  > The script handles common input errors and prompts the user to re-enter the information if needed.
